Continuous Delivery Project :: assign SecurityGroup

1) Jenkins is not taking any information from nexus nor tomcat
so the Security Group of Jenkins Should Be ::
ssh ==> port:22 ==> Myip
Custom TCP ==> port:8080 ==> Myip


2) Tomcat is taking input from ansible [here ansible is installed
in Jenkins] so the Security Group for Tomcat Should Be::
ssh ==> port:22 ==> Myip
Custom TCP ==> Port :: 8080 ==> Myip
Custom TCP ==> Port :: 22 ==> Jenkins Security Group



3) Nexus :: Jenkins is uploading artifacts to nexus & 
Tomcat is downloading artifacts from nexus
So the Security Group of Nexus Should Be ::
ssh ==> port :: 22 ==> Myip
Custom TCP ==> Port :: 8081 ==> Myip
Custom TCP ==> Port :: 8081 ==> Jenkins Security Group
Custom TCP ==> Port :: 8081 ==> Tomcat Security Group
